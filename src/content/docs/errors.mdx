Stripe uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Stripe’s servers (these are rare).

Some `4xx` errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g., a card is declined) include an error code that briefly explains the error reported.

## Attributes

<Attribute text="type" type="enum">
The type of error returned. One of `api_error`, `card_error`, `idempotency_error`, or `invalid_request_error`
</Attribute>
<Attribute text="code" type="nullable string">
For some errors that could be handled programmatically, a short string indicating the error code reported.
</Attribute>
<Attribute text="decline_code" type="nullable string">
For card errors resulting from a card issuer decline, a short string indicating the card issuer’s reason for the decline if they provide one.
</Attribute>
<Attribute text="message" type="nullable string">
A human-readable message providing more details about the error. For card errors, these messages can be shown to your users.
</Attribute>
<Attribute text="param" type="nullable string">
If the error is parameter-specific, the parameter related to the error. For example, you can use this to display a message near the correct form field.
</Attribute>
<Attribute text="payment_intent" type="nullable dictionary">
The PaymentIntent object for errors returned on a request involving a PaymentIntent.
</Attribute>
<Attribute text="charge" type="nullable string">
For card errors, the ID of the failed charge.
</Attribute>
<Attribute text="payment_method_type" type="nullable string">
If the error is specific to the type of payment method, the payment method type that had a problem. This field is only populated for invoice-related errors.

<Attribute text="request_log_url" type="nullable string">
A URL to the request log entry in your dashboard.

<Attribute text="setup_intent" type="nullable dictionary">
The SetupIntent object for errors returned on a request involving a SetupIntent.

### HTTP STATUS CODE SUMMARY

 CODE | STATUS | DESCRIPTION
--- | --- | ---
200 | OK | Everything worked as expected.
400 | Bad Request | unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.
401 | Unauthorized | No valid API key provided.
402 | Request Failed | The parameters were valid but the request failed.
403 | Forbidden | The API key doesn’t have permissions to perform the request.
404 | Not Found | The requested resource doesn’t exist.
409 | Conflict | The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key).
429 | Too Many Requests | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests.
500, 502, 503, 504 | Server Errors | Something went wrong on Stripe’s end. (These are rare.)

### ERROR TYPES

TYPE | DESCRIPTION
--- | ---
`api_error` | API errors cover any other type of problem (e.g., a temporary problem with Stripe’s servers), and are extremely uncommon.
`card_error` | Card errors are the most common type of error you should expect to handle. They result when the user enters a card that can’t be charged for some reason.
`idempotency_error` | dempotency errors occur when an Idempotency-Key is re-used on a request that does not match the first request’s API endpoint and parameters.
`invalid_request_error` | Invalid request errors arise when your request has invalid parameters.
