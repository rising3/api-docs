To act as connected accounts, clients can issue requests using the Stripe-Account special header. Make sure that this header contains a Stripe account ID, which usually starts with the acct_ prefix.

The value is set per-request as shown in the adjacent code sample. Methods on the returned object reuse the same account ID.
